A fork of the macOS share extension maxgrass/SendToKodi where I've added minimal support for it to act as a macOS system service as well. 

# SendToKodi
Send URLs to be played on Kodi via the MacOS sharing system or via system services. Default port 8080 is used.

## Requires this addon on the Kodi part:
